 * The LegacyRepository is a data-centric service for the {@link Legacy} entity.

 * Search logic is driven by 2 kinds of parameters: a {@link Legacy} instance used
 * as a properties holder against which the search will be performed and a {@link SearchParameters}
 * instance from where you can control your search options including the usage
 * of named queries.
